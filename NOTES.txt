**SQL
To create a data base we have to use 
CREATE TABLE queary.(CREATE TABLE Student;)

USE student;\\to use the created database.

CREATE TABLE Student info
  (
   studentiD int,
   student name varchar(8000),
    dateofbirth DATE
  );
to drop the table we have to use//DROP TABLE STUDENT INFO

The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
 The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.
**ALTER TABLE student info;
ALTER TABLE student info Add Blood Group varchar(8000);
**
NOT NULL:-
The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values. This enforces a field to always contain a value, 
which means that you cannot insert a new record, or update a record without adding a value to this field.
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(2554) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(2535) NOT NULL,
    Age int
);
UNIQUE:-
SQL UNIQUE Constraint
The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.

Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.

A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.

However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.

QUIRES:-
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int
);
CHECK:-
The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.

If you define a CHECK constraint on a column it will allow only certain values for this column.

If you define a CHECK constraint on a table it can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns in the row.
QUIRES:-
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CHECK (Age>=18)
);
INDEX:-
The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in tables.

INSERT INTO command use to inserting the some info
** INSERT
 INTO student values('ripon','11.09.1999',india)
